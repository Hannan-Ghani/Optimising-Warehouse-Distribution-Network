# Optimising-Warehouse-Distribution-Network

This project is to find the optimal route for distribution network of a major supermarket. 

There are 2 main warehouses (W1 and W2) and 23 stores at locations (1-23). 

Deliveries will be carried out everyday from their two warehouses to all 23 stores with the vehicles returning to the warehouses everyday.

Exact geographic locations of those warehouses have been shown in the image and also available in excel file provided in this repository.

There are two types of vehicle that the supermarket can use:

1- Van which costs £1 per mile and can deliver to 4 stores in one go

2- Lorry which costs £2 per mile and can deliver to 16 stores in one go

Aim of this project is to minimise the daily costs and find the best strategy such that every store recieves it's delivery and both the warehouses have correct 

number of vehicles at the end of the day so the deliveries can be carried out the next day.
